# Reflection & Reporting
## 1. Summary
This app is a SwiftUI-based project that allows users to trace simple shapes (circle and square) on screen. While tracing, the app provides multimodal feedback: haptics and tonal audio when the finger is on the correct path, with stronger feedback at corners. The interface is styled with a maroon-purple gradient, capsule-style shape selector, and a status badge that indicates whether the trace is on or off the path.
